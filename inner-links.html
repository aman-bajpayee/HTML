      Routine core analysis attempts to give only the very basic properties of unpreserved core.
These are basic rock dimensions, core porosity, grain density, gas permeability, and water
saturation. Taken in context routine data can provide a useful guide to well and reservoir
performance, provided its limitations are appreciated. These limitations arise because routine
porosity and permeability measurements are always made with gases on cleaned, dried core at
room conditions. Such conditions are distinctly different from the actual reservoir situation.
Thus routine data should be applied to the reservoir state with caution. This is especially true
for permeability measurements. Routine core analysis data is cheap, and often form the great
majority of the dataset representing reservoir core data. A schematic diagram of common
RCAL measurements is given as Figure 1.2
